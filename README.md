# Book Hunt
A project that aims to replicate the experience of browsing books at a physical library. After an initial search users explore the virtual bookshelf by choosing a subject of a book they like to bring up similar books. The project is fully responsive and works great on tablets/phones where the device can be physically turned to read titles on the spines.

# Tools Used
* Bootstrap
* jQuery
* AJAX
* OpenLibrary API
* Yahoo Query Language

# Problems
I would like to load a description of the book when it is inspected, but the OpenLibrary API does not have this information for most books. I have looked into other APIs but none have grouping of books by subject/Dewey Decimal Number which is in my view the most crucial feature for this project.
